# RockPaperScissors

Rock paper scissors game to five rounds.

This game pits the player against a computer which randomly selects rock paper or scissors.

This game was created as an assignment for the Odin Project. 

The first iteration of this game was played in the console. 

UI was then added which allowed users to choose their seleciton by clicking an image. 

I learned a lot about DOM manipulation during the second iteration of the project as this allowed the score and player selection to be displayed on a webpage.
